## It learnt from [here](https://github.com/CompleteBlenderCreator/10.VFX)

### Introduction to VFX & CGI ###



### Video Effects (VFX) ###

+ All about combining our Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) with real world environments.
+ This can be models, particle effects etc.
+ We will start with a still image and place a model into it.
+ After we have mastered that we will conquer video footage!

**Choosing Your Subject**

+ You can follow along with me, choose your own path or both!
+ Keep it simple, this goes for both your model AND the “real” space it is going to occupy.

### Good Source Material ###

+ Picture/photo, video or even another render
+ We’ll grab a photo and check out it’s settings.
+ This is important with both stills and videos.
+ With you own video keep a note of the settings as they’re often lost

### Introduction to Compositing ###

+ Bringing different renders together into one final render.
+ Compositing is done in the Node Editor.
+ View your composite changes live.
+ Learn how to scale a background image independently of the final render resolution.

### Matching Camera Settings ###

+ We will setup the camera using the settings gathered from the picture.
+ Reiterate the importance of accurate camera data.
+ Use the Text Editor to store data for reference.
+ Start setting up a scene to match the photo.

### Mathematics And Images ###

+ Can be difficult to comprehend at first.
+ Initially focus on monochrome (Grayscale).
+ Reminder that Colour is generated through 3 channels, Red, Green and Blue, with values from 0-1 (Sliders show 0-255).
+ Each Pixel will have its own values.
+ Use one value for all Pixels

**Basic Mathematics**

+ Adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying are just as you would expect them to be.
+ Values that are less than 0 or greater than 1 are passed through unless clamped.
+ Colour>Mix and Convertor>Math nodes function almost the same, however there are different options.

### Overlaying Images ###

+ Background Image - Visible
+ Our Object - Visible
+ Our Objects Shadow- Visible
+ Ground - Used for capturing the shadow -Hidden
+ How we can isolate the object by itself.
+ How we can isolate the shadow by itself.

### Extracting Image Data ###

+ We could take the background image and map it to an object that is visible in our render.
+ We have all the 3D data to make a comparison scene.
+ Create another Render Layer for comparison without the object and therefore no shadow.
+ Need to consider the order of these layers.

### Blender Camera Tracking: Footage ###



### Blender Camera Tracking: Markers ###

+ Markers track parts of the footage.
+ Uses similar controls to the 3D Editor
+ You’ll need a minimum of 8 in the scene to effectively track a camera, more the better.
+ Well have a look at Pattern Size and Search size, discovering what they do.
+ Recommend placing markers manually.

### Solving Camera Motion ###

+ You need the right camera details!
+ Check the accuracy of our markers
+ Average camera solve error of \<1 is ideal, but not always necessary. We have to test and assess.
+ May have to refine your markers more.

### CGI / VFX Final Scene ###

+ Import assets you wish to use in your scene.
+ Adjust your camera's view, if it is slightly out.
+ Get the ground ready for shadows.

### Transparent Backgrounds ###

+ Learn how to set your Background as transparent.
+ The options are different in both Blender Render and Cycles.
+ Relatively straightforward - however the options are hidden away!
